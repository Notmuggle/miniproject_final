This was the inventory management project me amd my friends made for our pre final year project
We have used Arduino programming
RFID cards and a reader module.
The objects present in an inventory is shown in the LCD display when it reads one card going inside.While the same card go out or 
to say when it reads the same card twice,the second time it gets deducted from the stock.
The import and export from the inventory is shown accordingly.
This is a really premitive version of inventory management and has several loopholes.
